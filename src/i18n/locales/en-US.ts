      step1: '1. Use git-log to query the current branch of the project to get commit statistics aggregated by hour and by day',
      step2: '2. Convert the query results from the local script into URL parameters and open the URL in the browser',
      step3: '3. Get data from the URL, process it with some rules, and visualize the results',

    safety: {
      title: 'Is It Safe',
      point1: '1. Neither the script nor the web side will collect any data',
      point2: '2. Except for general data such as analysis start time and commit results, the URL itself does not leak sensitive information such as project names',

      q1a1: 'The 996 index is defined by this project to reflect the data indicator of project overtime.',
      q1a2: 'After standardizing the overtime situation, we can conveniently compare the work intensity of cross-team and cross-company projects.',
      q2: 'Q: When are the analysis results of code996 inaccurate?',
      q2a1: 'The script counts the overall commit time of the project by default, representing the work status of all participants in the project during this period, which may deviate from personal actual conditions',
      q2a2: 'In addition to coding, we also need meetings, documentation, learning, slacking off, etc., so it cannot cover actual working time',
      q2a3: 'Cross-national and cross-time zone development projects cannot be correctly counted',
      q2a4: 'Projects with irregular working hours (such as personal open source projects) cannot be counted either',
      q3: 'Q: Problems with the script?',
